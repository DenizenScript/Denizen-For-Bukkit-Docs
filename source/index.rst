Denizen: Text Tutorials
=======================

Welcome to the Denizen Text Tutorials! Here, you will learn about the various parts of Denizen, how to use them, and how
to find success in the endless ways to customize your server!

Not sure where to start? No problem! :doc:`Click here <docs/getting-started/index>` to jump to the first official page
of this extended text tutorial and start reading. The bottom of each page will direct you to the next and previous pages
of this guide.

.. note::
    This guide largely assumes that you already have a Spigot server set up and ready to use.

    :doc:`Section 1.2 <docs/getting-started/denizen-folder>` covers the Denizen folder and its various
    files/directories.

Updates to this Beginner's Guide
================================

As Denizen continues to evolve, there may be slight changes that are not immediately reflected in this guide. However,
this does not mean that this document will become obsolete. Whenever there is a syntactical or technical change in
Denizen, this guide will update as appropriate, as soon as possible, in the context of a beginner's guide.

If you wish to see the full changelog for this guide, or contribute improvements to it, see the `Docs GitHub Repo`__.
Any issue reports relating to this guide specifically go there.

The tutorial videos are still a good place to learn Denizen in an interactive manner. Videos 2-13 and 15-27 will be
covered by this guide. If you want to learn by video and not by text-based guides, you can view the videos at:
https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/vids/

While the videos are still relevant and should be considered good learning material, some of the scripts shown in the
videos sometimes have slightly outdated syntax compared to the current standard. We will try to use some or all of the
example scripts in the videos while keeping them as modern as possible.

Of course, we won't limit ourselves to the videos. The purpose of this guide is to help you in the best way possible!
Additional information and sections may be added as we see fit.
