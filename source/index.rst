Denizen: Beginner's Guide
================================================

Welcome to the Denizen Beginner's Guide! Here, you will learn about the various
parts of Denizen, how to use them, and how to find success in the endless ways
to customize your server!

Not sure where to start? No problem! :doc:`Click here
<docs/getting-started/index>` to jump to the first official page of this guide
and start reading. The bottom of each page will direct you to the next and
previous pages of this guide.

.. note::
  This guide largely assumes that you already have a Spigot server set up and
  ready to use.

Updates to this Beginner's Guide
================================

As Denizen continues to evolve, there may be slight changes that are not
immediately reflected in this guide. However, this does not mean that this
document will become obsolete. Whenever there is a syntactical or technical
change in Denizen, this guide will update as appropriate, as soon as possible,
in the context of a beginner's guide.

If you wish to see the full changelog for this guide, or contribute improvements
to it, see the `Docs GitHub Repo
<https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen-For-Bukkit-Docs>`_. Any issue reports
relating to this guide specifically go there.

You can post issues relating to Denizen itself and view changes to Denizen on
the `Denizen GitHub Repo<https://github.com/DenizenScript/Denizen-For-Bukkit>`_.

The tutorial videos are still a good place to learn Denizen in an interactive
manner. Videos 2-13 and 15-27 will be covered by this guide. If you want to
learn by video and not by text-based guides, you can view the videos at:
https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/vids/

While the videos are still relevant and should be considered good learning
material, some of the scripts shown in the videos sometimes have slightly
outdated syntax compared to the current standard. We will try to use all of the
example scripts in the videos while keeping them as modern as possible.

Of course, we won't limit ourselves to the videos. The purpose of this guide is
to help you in the best way possible! Additional information and sections may be
added as we see fit.
